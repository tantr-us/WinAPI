## Introduction

This repository is a collection of personal projects that serve as experiments with the Windows API using the C language in Visual Studio. Each project demonstrates a specific aspect of Windows programming, helping to develop a deeper understanding of Windows internals, system calls, memory management, and GUI interactions.

The projects in this repository range from simple console applications to more complex programs that interact with the Windows GUI. They are designed to be a hands-on learning resource and may not be production-ready.

## Projects
- [ReadWriteConsole](ReadWriteConsole) - write text to console ‚úÖ
- [GenericString](GenericString) - write generic string to console ‚úÖ
- [HexDump](HexDump) - dump binary file to hexadecimal and ASCII ‚úÖ
- [ExceptionHandling](ExceptionHandling) - experiment exception handling using __try and __execept ‚úÖ
- [ReverseString](ReverseString) - read a string input and reverse it üî≤
- [Heap/SimpleHeap](Heap/SimpleHeap) - read a string input and store it in the heap üî≤
